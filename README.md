Player Entry Screen Instructions:

There are two teams, red and green, with up to 8 players in each. 
Each player enters their ID and codename (press tab to move from field to field). 
If the user is a new player, then they will be allowed to enter a codename after entering their ID.
If the user is a returning player, then their codename will be automatically set.
New player's information will be stored in the database for when they return.
